## `file157.py`

- used with statement for writing file
- moved import to top of the file
- change all occurrences of `pi_gen.__next__()` to `nex(pi_gen)`
- discarded `the_variable_that_contains_next_approximations_of_pi_from_generator` variable
- `my_pi_2` now contains values generated by `pi_gen_2` instead of `pIgEn3`
- renamed `pIgEn3` to `pi_gen_3`
- printed values of `my_pi_3`
- `my_pi_3` now contains values from `pi_gen_3`

## both

- renamed declared function `enumerate` to `print_py_container` because `enumerate` is already a function in python's standard library
