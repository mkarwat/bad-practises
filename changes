1. Commit names are not descriptive ("very important commit")
2. File names have no meaning, no clear main file -> changed names to main.py and pi_functions.py
3. Unnecessary global variables.
4. Function "foo" uses mathematical variables with meaningless names (b,c) so there
   should be a description of used formulas instead of a obscure comment.
5. Class names should be written in camelCase not snake_case
6. "*" symbol in imports should be avoided if possible, imports should select only required modules
7. Files should be open with "with" command.
8. Except should be used to catch errors
9. "try" code block is too big, too many different exception could happen
10. "my_pi.mth(pi_gen.__next__())" should be optimized in loop
11. Variables should have meaningful names.
12. Instead of "type(x) == list" there should be used "isistance()"
13. foo() should be remaned to a meaningful name -> approximate_pi
14. "yield 'finished'" return wrong type -> should be removed
15. missing "if __name__ == '__main__'" in main file
16. "enumerate" is a already used name so it causes unexpected redefinition -> should be renamed
