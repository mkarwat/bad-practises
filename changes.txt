- renamed file names so they are meaningful and describe them
- modified PiContainer class name (for classes PascalCase should be used)
- modified class variables' names and functions' names t more meaningful
- deleted unnecessary globals
- aplied correct fomating (added spaces)
- changed iterator 'hello' to something more meaningful
- comment in function 'calculate_pi' definitely too long, does not contain any sppecific information (deleted)
- removed unnecessary yield "finish" (exception will be raised when finished)
- move enumerate to PiContainer class and changed its name since the function under this name already exists
- moved import to the top of the file and changed from '*' to specific functions, classes (no point to import all of them)
- repeatable code lines should be written with loops
- catching exceptions should be specified (not catching all of them)
- added Path import to specify the path of the file 
- writing to file can be done with simple "with open", much easier (don't have to remember about closing the file)
- changed iterator 'varaible the_variable_that_contains_next_approximations_of_pi_from_generator' to '_', because anyway it is not used
- added value property to the class 'best_approx', better to keep such things in class
